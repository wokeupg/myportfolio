Hi, I'm glad you're here! I made this website to bring the projects on my resume to life, and so you can get to know me a little better. Feel free to explore my work, check out the demos under [Portfolio], and please reach out if you’d like to connect. 

About me
======
During my undergraduate studies, I gained familiarity with:

- **Embedded Systems**: Developed microcontroller-based systems integrating hardware and software, including a concussion-detection device using accelerometer and gyroscope data and threshold-based impact analysis, and a pinball machine diagnostic tool for real-time signal monitoring and fault detection.

- **FPGA Design**: Implemented a Space Shooters–style arcade game on an FPGA using SystemVerilog, designing synchronous digital logic, hierarchical modules, and finite state machines; implemented VGA timing control, frame buffering, collision detection, and hardware-driven input handling.

- **Operating Systems**: Built Linux-based operating system from scratch, implementing context switching, interrupt descriptor tables, paging-based memory management, system call interfaces, and cooperative/preemptive scheduling.

- **Discrete Logic Research**: Applied logic-based modeling to construct and analyze yield-optimization strategies for DeFi farming, focusing on constraint satisfaction and profit maximization under dynamic reward structures.

- **Cryptography**: Designed and implemented a password encrytion tool that satisfies the constraints of Perfect Secrecy using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad" target="_blank">One-Time Pads</a>.

- **Databases**: Designed normalized relational schemas and implemented optimized MySQL queries (JOINs, indexing strategies, aggregation, and transaction handling) for a pet adoption web application.

Campus Involvement
------
**iVenture/Founders/NSF Innovation Corps Fellow**

I joined Founders to find like-minded peers who were interested in entrepreneurship. Throughout my time in this club and iVenture, I hosted and co-hosted events, gave presentations and pitches at Research Park, iHotel, Avant, ChicagoBooth, and at the Gies College of Business, and developed close relationships with my team and the teams we were working alongside.

**Women in Electrical & Computer Engineering (WECE)**

I participated in this helpful academic and professional community by establishing relationships with ECE peers through club activities. Taking part in social and networking events strengthened my collaboration with others and helped me find a sense of belonging.

Hobbies
------
In my free time, I like to play tennis, play chess, run 5ks, and solve online puzzles:
