Hi, I'm glad you're here! I made this website to bring the projects on my resume to life, and so you can get to know me a little better. Feel free to explore my work, check out the demos under [Portfolio], and please reach out if you’d like to connect. 

About me
======
During my undergraduate studies, I gained familiarity with:

- Embedded Systems: connecting software and hardware to create two of my projects, a concussion-detection sensor for football players and a pinball diagnostic tool for enthusiasts
- Low-level programming: created an operating system from scratch
- Discrete Structures: worked on applying discrete logic to maximize profit in the field of DeFi farming on Coinbase, a relatively new area with limited research
- Cryptographic Systems: created a password tool for individual use based on perfect secrecy
- Databases: wrote the MySQL queries for a pet adoption website

Campus Involvement
------
**iVenture/Founders/NSF Innovation Corps Fellow**

I joined Founders to find like-minded peers who were interested in entrepreneurship. Throughout my time in this club and iVenture, I hosted and co-hosted events, gave presentations and pitches at Research Park, iHotel, Avant, ChicagoBooth, and at the Gies College of Business, and developed close relationships with my team and the teams we were working alongside.

**Women in Electrical & Computer Engineering (WECE)**

I participated in this helpful academic and professional community by establishing relationships with ECE peers through club activities. Taking part in social and networking events strengthened my collaboration with others and helped me find a sense of belonging.

Hobbies
------
In my free time, I like to play tennis, play chess, run 5ks, and solve online puzzles:
